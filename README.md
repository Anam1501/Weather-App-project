# Weather-App
This is a simple web application to forecast weather of different cities of any country by using Angular CLI and a weather API. User can enter the city name and get the current weather data of that city.

What is an API? 🤷🏼‍♂

API stands for application programming interface, which is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.
